    <p>Welcome to Insomniac DAW! We have a selection of synths to play through. You can play these synths through clicking on the key or pressing 1 to 5 for sharps and flats and q to u for white notes. The piano takes this even further from q-p and a-f for white notes and sharps and flats up to 0. Have fun :) </p> 
    <p id = "Hint">Hint: some synths make interesting nosies when multiple notes are played at once. Feel free to explore to your hearts content.</p>
